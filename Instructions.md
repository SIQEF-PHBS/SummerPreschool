<strong>How to study Computational Economics and Finance Summer School</strong>

<p><strong>From</strong>: Thomas Sargent</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Please study  the material in the videos thoroughly.  When I study materials like this on videos, I watch them repeatedly and rewind and replay sections that  confuse me. I take my time! Subsequent classes starting in the fall will assume that you have mastered the material and will not spend any time answering questions about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I urge  you to make up examples of functions and classes files in Jupyter notebooks and get comfortable using and creating them. Also, create  some stand alone Python .py files.  If you want to have even more fun, make up your own Python <code>module</code> and practice importing it.  There is no substitute for practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within a day or two, we will provide  you with a link to a github repository that contains the Jupyter notebooks, some of the Python code, and other resources that we cited during the lectures. I urge you to familiarize yourselves  with how to use git.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can learn about git from the following resources:</p>

<p>I recommend installing and learning to use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as an environment in which to do Python coding, latex, and other things. (You can even run Jupyter notebooks in VSCode).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VSCode can be used to manage github nicely.  Here is how you can learn about that:</p>

<p>If you want to study other online materials about Python, here are two good sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an excellent &quot;Python programming course for engineers&quot;. I highly recommend it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQyKbdn5H3E&amp;list=PLgA4wLGrqI-k51wG52O5PpDZAIL6eyvDK">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQyKbdn5H3E&amp;list=PLgA4wLGrqI-k51wG52O5PpDZAIL6eyvDK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an online Python course from the ground up. A very talented and engaging teacher named Mosh:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>the quantecon lectures introducing Python programming:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After and only after you have fully mastered the material in the videos that we have provided (i.e, the ones by Chase, Spencer, and Tom that we  have provided as part of the summer school curriculum) and you are very ambitious and have spare time, then you can begin studying some of the following materials that we&apos;ll be  using in the main course starting late in August:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the first several quantecon lectures here</p>
<p><a href="https://python.quantecon.org/index_toc.html">https://python.quantecon.org/index_toc.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some of the material about data science here</p>
